            <h2>About the Trust</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Anugya Kainkaryam Charitable Trust</strong> is founded to uphold the sacred tradition of <em>Anugya Kainkaryam</em> and <em>Aagya Kainkaryam</em> in our temples. Anugya Kainkaryam refers to the chanting of Veda parayanam, Divya Prabandham, and shlokas of Poorvacharyas on special and daily occasions in temples. Rooted in the ethos of <strong>“Sarveshameva Dharmanam Uthamo Vaishnavo Vithihi”</strong>, the trust honors the vision that rendering Bhagavad Aradhanam is the foremost dharma for all Vaishnavas.<br><br>
                Our services include recitation of Vedas and Divya Prabandhams, temple cleaning, making garlands, offering deepams, and more. The trust is committed to supporting and honoring those who render these divine services in Divyadesams and other temples of Emperumal.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>“Rakshathe Bhagavan Vishnuhu: Bhaktanam Athamasareeravath”</i><br>
                A Vaishnavan rendering Bhagavad Aradhanam will always be in the vision of Emperumal and protected as His own.
